# Snowfall and Snow Depth for EPIC and IKON Mountains
Skiing is my main winter hobby and this year I was fortunate enough to spend a week skiing in Colorado. I created a python function on juypter notebook to scrape snowfall and snow depth data from onthesnow.com. I focused on the mountains that are on the EPIC and IKON ski passes. Pandas is utltized to organize the data. I am creating a database on PostgreSQL. After I collect a little more data, I will begin on launching an app that allows users to filter through the data. This project has allowed me to connect my love of skiing with my growing passion for data science.

## Tools and Resources
* Python/Pandas
